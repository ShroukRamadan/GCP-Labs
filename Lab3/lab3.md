4. What is the type of GCP Load Balancer that is created for your LB service?



5. Use kubectl to view container logs.



6. Use cloud logging service to view container logs. [hint: search about cloud logging service for gke]



7. (Bonus) setup a HTTP load balancer for your deployment using the kubernetes ingress resource




8. Create an autopilot GKE cluster with public control plane.




9. Enforce the cluster’s control plane to accept only connections from your local machine
